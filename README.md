# OpenWasteland
An open source recreation of Interplay's 1988 Wasteland! :+1:

**Why:**

Because while Wasteland is pretty well documented and reverse engineered, it's a nightmare to work with.

The idea here is to include an expanded feature set, such as:
  
  -Pop up windows, 
  
  -Better hotkeys, 
  
  -Support for higher resolution graphics, 
  
  -Support for more and higher quality sound effects as well as music. 
  
  -Also you know, all the benefits that come from being open source, like ease of moddability
  
  -And of course custom campaigns without the pain that comes from loading them into DOS Wasteland

The plan is to have it run on decompiled Wasteland data from WLSuite tools. A fully decompiled Wasteland will run in this engine, however it will not be provided. It's up to the user to decompile their Wasteland files.
Instead, 1.0 will feature a fully independent set of resources and maps: Spaceland!

**Projected release date:**

Fucking never.
