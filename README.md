# OpenWasteland
An open source recreation of Interplay's 1988 Wasteland!

Why:
Because while Wasteland is pretty well documented and reverse engineered, it's a nightmare to work with.

The idea here is to include an expanded feature set, such as pop up windows, better hotkeys, support for higher resolution graphics, support for more and higher quality sound effects as well as music. Also you know, all the benefits that come from being open source.

The plan is to have it run on decompiled Wasteland data from WLSuite tools. A fully decompiled Wasteland will run in this engine, however it will not be provided.
Instead, 1.0 will feature a fully independent set of resources and maps: Spaceland!

Projected release date:
Fucking never.
